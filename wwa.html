              <h3>Nayr Oriuges</h3>
              <p>
                Nayr Oriuges has served as the President and CEO since 2016, and
                he brings not only a wealth of business experience (non-profit
                and corporate), but also a unique perspective to A WORTHY CAUSE.
                As a young child living in a toxic community in the Philippines
                during his early childhood, Nayr suffered a life-altering bout
                with Anxiety and Depression – a mental illness that greatly
                impacted his life and ostracized him from society, and
                ultimately, his family. But in God's grace Nayr overcome his
                mental health problems with the help of the experts.

            <p>
              When Nayr was only 5 years old, his father dropped him and his
              sister off an orphanage, where they spent the next 5 years before
              being adopted by a couple in the U.S. Nayr eventually graduated
              from Cornell University with a degree in Agricultural Economics
              and earned his MBA in Marketing and Finance from Northwestern
              University.
              <br />
              <br />
              Prior to joining A Worthy Cause, Nayr held executive-level
              positions with nonprofits including Child Fund International,
              Heifer International, ChildHelp and WorldVision US and in
              corporations including: Bristol-Myers Squibb, Conagra Foods,
              AmeriTrade and Univera Life Sciences.
              <br />
              <br />
              In 2016, Nayr was approached by A Worthy Cause. Because MAP is a
              Christian organization, Nayr saw this as an opportunity to live
              out his faith through his work. He has dedicated his life to
              bringing critically needed medicines and health supplies to some
              of the world’s poorest people, so that no child suffers the same
              fate that he did simply because of a lack of access to medicine.
              <br />
              <br />
              <strong>
                God redeemed every experience in Nayr’s life, to
                prepare him for his role at A Worthy Cause. He is particularly
                motivated by Jesus’s words in Matthew 25:36, “I was sick, and
                you looked after me.” Nayr is passionate about A Worthy Cause
                mission and he invites you to join him in helping to provide
                life changing welfare to people in need around the world.
